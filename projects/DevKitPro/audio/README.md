# Audio Examples

Homebrew requires a copy of the DSP firmware to be present at sdmc:/3ds/dspfirm.cdc. This can be obtained by using [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS) - select "Miscellaneous options..." in the Rosalina menu then "Dump DSP firmware" from there. This file can be copied to Citra's virtual SD folder but a 0 byte file is sufficient for homebrew audio to work since Citra uses HLE.
